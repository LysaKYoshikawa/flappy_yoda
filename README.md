  #  :star: About the project

Flappy Yoda is a personalized version of the flappy bird. In this game we want Babby Yoda to pass through the openings in the barriers with the power of his strength.
The idea of ​​the project was to put javascript and css concepts into practice.
My project aims to put into practice studies of css animation, javascript object orientation, display flex, within a universe that I am particularly passionate about, which is Star Wars

## :rocket: Main challenges

My main challenge was to make Babby Yoda go through the correct path. And when it hit the barrier, it stopped.

Display flex and Position were concepts that required hours of study for me to provide in the expected position.
